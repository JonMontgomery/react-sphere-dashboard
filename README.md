## Sphere Dashboard

Bootstrapped with CreativeTIM template and Material UI, I am reinventing this dashboard to be an all in one influencer campaign management and search tool.

Node backend folder architecture based on [Bulletproof node.js project architecture üõ°Ô∏è](https://softwareontheroad.com/ideal-nodejs-project-structure/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=subreddit)

## Mantra/Goal

* Intuitive
* Maintainable
* Immutable
* Efficient
* TO LEARN

## Tech Stack
* React
* Materials-UI
* Node
* Express
* Sequelizer
* MySQL

## Unit Testing
Done with Mocha + Chai.

## React Node Modules
* material-ui
* chartist

## Node Server Modules

* Express - workflow handling
* Dotenv - storing sensitive environment variables
* Passport - user authentication
* Sequelizer - ORM
* mySQL - database querying
* mocha/chai for unit testing

## Functionality 

* influencer search
* profile view
* campaign management/organization

## Concerns
* extremely long get request URIs
  * according to [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49893776/how-to-send-a-huge-parameter-list-to-a-get-request), it's standard and ok. Also modern browsers support an insane amount of characters in the URL
